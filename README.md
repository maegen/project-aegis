---------------------
Every addition, feature, improvement, or fix should be developed in a branch off of the "main" with a descriptive name. If you are working with a specific task (ex: "Security Tasks"), you will be working off a branch named "security-tasks".

Once you determine your branch to be ready to merge back into the main branch, open a pull request. Your pull request will be reviewed by the moderator (Maegen) who may make suggestions before it is approved and merged into the main branch. Your branch will then be deleted.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please do NOT commit directly into the main branch because any wrong move can alter the whole project. Committing to a branch means you are branching off the main repository and making a copy of your own without compromising the main code. Making a pull request is essentially letting the moderator look over your changes and reviewing them before publishing it into the main branch.

This is how to link your GitHub account to Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github
